    Q3. And how can Farmer of India can avoid the middle man for a better value os produce?
    Q4. How can Farmer can get all details news, Market info like mandi rates, and how farmer can connect to other farmer? etc.. etc..
    
And thousand of question are there to this problem statement.

but a big functionality to each of us end to end user. Here, user can buy or sell their produce on the market rate or 
rate we wann to sell or user can get a place where he can grow business from buying from other farmer from ground.
and he directly contact to buyer or seller for a further exchange. and Farmer can sell their produce to each user on 
nearest location based at good price. and Krishi is the extension to the gov Support to Farmer .
